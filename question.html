<h1>How did Anti semitism begin?</h1>

<h2>The term Anti-Semitism was created in 1879 by a German agitator Wilhelm Marr, although the acts of Anti-semitism date back all the way to 70 C.E, when the Temple of Jerusalem was destroyed by the Romans. After this devastating defeat, which was interpreted by Jew and Christian alike as a sign of divine punishment, the Gospels diminished Roman responsibility and expressed Jewish culpability in the death of Jesus both explicitly (Matthew 27:25) and implicitly. Jews were depicted as killers of the Son of God.</h2>
<h2>Contrary to popular belief, Anti-semitism did not begin with Adolf Hitler; Anti-Semitic attitudes date back to ancient times. In most parts of Europe, Jewish people were denied citizenship and forced to live in ghettos, away from the cities. Anti-Jewish riots called Pogroms swept the Russian Empire during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, and anti-Semitic incidents have increased in parts of Europe, the Middle East and North America in the last several years.</h2>
<h2> There were a lot of acts of anti-semitism througout history. Those include:</h2>
<h3>1190     The Third Crusade</h3>
<h3>England showed support for the Crusades where the Jews were killed for supposedly murdering Jesus. Pogroms took place against Jews all over the country. The Jews of London were killed on the day of the King's coronation. In York, the Jews of the city took refuge in a castle, but with no hope of survival after three days' fighting, all five hundred of the Jews chose to commit suicide rather than be butchered by their attackers.</h3>
<h3>1290</h3>
<h3>Jews were expelled from England.</h3>
<h3>Other examples:

    Until the 19th century, many European Jews were forced to practice specific jobs, such as money lending. They thereby took on a social role that was immediately despised, and were accused of being corrupt and avaricious. (In fact, the Old Testament specifically demands fairness in all financial/business practices).
    
    Jews were accused of murdering Christian children and using their blood in Jewish rituals. (In fact, the Old Testament has specific rules on Jews not having any contact at all with blood of any kind).
    
    Jews were accused of poisoning wells and spreading disease such as the Plague. (However, historians now believe that, due to the rules of Kashrut (strict rules on how to keep and cook food) listed in the Old Testament, fewer Jews died of the Plague - this is why rumours spread that the Jews were the cause of the Plague).
    
    The Nazis used many of these myths and stereotypes for their own propaganda purposes.</h3>

    <h2>Historian Raoul Hilberg has summed up the pattern of anti-Semitism as follows:

        12th century Crusades - "You have no right to live amongst us as Jews".
        
        16th century ghettos - "You have no right to live amongst us".
        
        20th century Nazis - "You have no right to live".</h2>

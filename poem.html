<h1>That even as we grieved, we grew.
    That even as we hurt, we hoped.
    That even as we tired, we tried.</h1>

          
          <h2>Explanation: The following lines of the poem “The Hill We Climb” really relate to the problem of anti-semitism. The haulocaust was a huge factor of how the history of Anti-semitism was created and left a huge scar in the world. Let me explain each line; “That even as we grieved, we grew.”. This line really relates to Anti-semitism because even as we lost loved ones, we learned to overcome and to grow and learn from history. “That even as we hurt, we hoped.” This line of the poem leads me to believe that multiple survivors from the tortures of the haulocaust hoped for a better future where they can raise thier children to lead a normal life and become grater than they would have ever hoped to be. The line “That even as we tired, we tried.” means to me that even though the Jewish people were hurt, they tried to build a better future for themselves.</h2>

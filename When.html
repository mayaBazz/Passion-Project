<h1>Anti-semitism has never fully come to a stop. Just a year ago, a Kosher bakery was terrorized and sent to flames. In 2021, the percentage of Ant-semitism cases has risen around 34% in the U.S. Similarily, Anti-semitism was peaked in the WWII when Leader Adolf Hitler was empowered. Almost all Jewish-owned stores in multiple continents were burned, terrorised, and vandalized. Children were torn away from mothers and fathers.</h1> 
<h2>It is important to learn about the history for one main reason: so that it never repeats itself. But now, people can use hurtful slogans from Hitler's empowerment to use against the Jewish communnity. Those include the 88 (Heil Hitler) and the swastika symbol. The following symbols show Anti-semitism in a very hurtful way.</h2>
<h2>On the topic of WWII, annefraank.org states "Hitler was born in Austria in 1889. He developed his political ideas in Vienna, a city with a large Jewish community, where he lived from 1907 to 1913. In those days, Vienna had a mayor who was very anti-Jewish, and hatred of Jews was very common in the city. During the First World War (1914-1918), Hitler was a soldier in the German army. At the end of the war he, and many other German soldiers like him, could not get over the defeat of the German Empire. The German army command spread the myth that the army had not lost the war on the battlefield, but because they had been betrayed. By a ‘stab in the back’, as it was called at the time. Hitler bought into the myth: Jews and communists had betrayed the country and brought a left-wing government to power that had wanted to throw in the towel." The following text explains very clearly on how Anti-semitism peaked in World War Two.</h2>
